## Abstract

This project aims to build a LiDAR-free subsystem for autonomous driving.
I am the DRI of this project. I am responsible for the design and build of the sensor rack. The sensor rack includes cameras, 3D and 4D automotive radars, scanning (imaging) radar, IMU, GPS, and two LiDARs for verification.
