My research interests center around **Robot Perception** and **State Estimation** with a strong drive to develop impactful robotic systems. This ambition has been shaped by my unwavering belief in the potential of robotics to enhance our world.

I am currently a grad student in Master of Science in [Robotic System Development (MRSD) at Carnegie Mellon](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu).
I was an associate researcher at [Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/index.aspx) working on autonomous vehicle perception for 1.5 year.
I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), advised by Prof. [Chieh-Chih (Bob) Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/chiehchihbobwang/home?authuser=0) and Prof. [Wen-Chieh (Steve) Lin](https://gpl.cs.nctu.edu.tw/wen-chieh-steve-lin/). I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYCU.

I am currently looking for 2026 Summer internship in Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
